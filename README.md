# Virtual-Stylist-Assistant

<i>Problem Statement:- The model looks at customer instagram and facebook images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing. The virtual Assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast fahion trends and lauch targetted marketing campaigns. In this project fashion MNIST dataset is used and a deep learning network is prepared to classify the images into 10 classes. Here we have a dataset of just grayscale images, so a much easier problem. Amazon Echo Look Style Assistant is an application of this.

Objective:- Suppose a customer likes particluar type of dress, so we can do targetted marketing to that specific customer. targetted marketing helps us to attract more customers thus increasing sales and profits of the retailer, that obviously he wants to maximize.</i>
